# LIRI 
##Node.js App

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Pass LIRI any of these four commands (search term afterwards optional):
* concert-this
* movie-this
* spotify-this-song
* do-what-it-says
